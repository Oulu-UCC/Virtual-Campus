# Virtual-Campus

This repository contains the work files (.blend) and .fbx (for importing directly to UE or Unity) of the University of Oulu building, a part of virtual Oulu.
Virtual campus is a small scale indoor virtual environment, where students and researchers can create applications that can be expanded to the virtual city.
Campus also has its own characteristics. It is an unusually wide and complex indoor area, and has potential for specific applications in education, emergency simulation/training, orientation, PR etc. 


The campus center hallway is 1 km long and the modelled area is wide, hence the models are divided into separate sections. Each original (except Tellus) .blend file also contains separate collision meshes, named collision_*, they can appear as grey block on the models after import, but should be easy to set invisible or deleted if not needed.
